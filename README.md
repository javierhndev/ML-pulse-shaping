# ML pulse shaping (in progress)
In this repository we keept the code to reproduce the ML paper for pulse shaping.

# Data extraction
To genereate the `galadriel_dataset_24_09_18.h5` dataset used in most of this project we need to run the `writing_dataset_and_goodness.py` Python script. The script needs to be executed in the Galadriel server and requires the `galadriel_db.py` module (which imports all the calls to MORIA).

The `2024_09_18_physicsrun - 20240918_inshot_tempcorrected.csv` is a database generated by Gil from a physics run on 240918. It is used oly to motivate the paper and to show the increase of energy (or particle count) for some values of the Dazzler.
